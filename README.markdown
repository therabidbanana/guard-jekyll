# Guard::Jekyll

Guard::Jekyll automatically rebuilds websites with the [Jekyll static site generator](http://jekyllrb.com/) every time files are modified.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'guard-jekyll'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install guard-jekyll

## Usage

Enter the Jekyll site directory for which you want to use Guard::Jekyll. Create a Guardfile using:

    $ guard init jekyll

Then execute:

    $ guard

Whenever you change a file in the Jekyll site directory now, the site will be rebuilt!

## Options

You can provide these options to Guard::Jekyll:

* `:source` the source directory which Jekyll reads files from.
* `:destination` the directory where Jekyll will write files to.
* `:config` array of configuration files for Jekyll.

Without options, Jekyll will use its built-in defaults.
